Terraform Taint:

You have created a new resource via terraform

users have made a lot of changes (both indra and inside the server)

two ways to deal with this: Import the changes to terraform /delete & recreate the resource

terraform taint command manually marks a terraform managed resource as tainted , forcing it to be destroyed and recretad on next apply
